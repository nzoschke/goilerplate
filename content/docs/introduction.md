## Welcome to JukeLab

**JukeLab** is a party music app built on a simple idea: **curate a collection of 100 albums, set up a device, and let your guests control the music all night.**

No more fighting over Bluetooth. No more one person playing DJ all night. Just great music, shared by everyone.

## The JukeLab Concept

The idea is simple but powerful:

> **You curate the collection. Your guests pick the songs. Everyone enjoys the party.**

Think of it like a classic jukebox in a bar, except:

- **You choose the records** (your 100 albums)
- **Guests browse and queue** from their own phones
- **The music never stops** thanks to smart shuffle

The result? A party where the music just works.

## What Makes JukeLab Different

### Curated, Not Random

Generic playlists feel impersonal. JukeLab puts your taste front and center—guests pick from albums you love.

### Shared Control

No more Bluetooth battles. Everyone can queue songs from their own device, but everything stays on-vibe because you've pre-approved the collection.

### Privacy First

We don't collect data about your music preferences or listening habits. Your jukebox, your business.

## How It Works

### 1. Curate Your Collection

Choose up to 100 albums from Spotify (or MP3s with Connoisseur plan). These become your jukebox's library.

### 2. Set Up Your Jukebox

Pick a device to be your jukebox—a tablet, old phone, or laptop works perfectly.

### 3. Share the Link

Send your guests a link. They can browse your collection and queue songs from their own devices.

### 4. Enjoy the Party

The music plays, guests contribute, and you can actually enjoy hosting instead of being the DJ.

## Who This Is For

### Party Hosts

Throw better parties with music everyone can contribute to. From house parties to wedding receptions.

### Music Lovers

Share your collection without hovering over the turntable. Let others discover the albums you love.

### Anyone Tired of Bluetooth Battles

If you've ever fought over the aux cord, JukeLab is for you.

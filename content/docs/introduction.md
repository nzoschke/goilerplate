## Welcome to Law of 100

**Law of 100** is a goal tracking app built on a simple principle: **do something 100 times to achieve mastery.**

Whether you're learning a new skill, building a habit, or working toward a personal goal, consistent repetition is the key to transformation. We help you track your progress and stay motivated on your journey.

## The Law of 100 Principle

The concept is simple but powerful:

> **When you do something 100 times, you move from beginner to competent. From conscious effort to unconscious mastery.**

- **100 push-ups** → Build strength and discipline
- **100 days of meditation** → Transform your mental clarity
- **100 writing sessions** → Develop your creative voice
- **100 coding challenges** → Master programming fundamentals

The specific goal matters less than the commitment to repetition. After 100 times, you're not just skilled - you're transformed.

## What Makes Us Different

### Simple by Design
No complicated features, no overwhelming dashboards. Just your goals, your progress, and the motivation to keep going.

### Focus on the Journey
We celebrate every rep, not just the destination. Your 47th repetition is just as important as your 100th.

### Privacy First
Your goals are private by default. Share only what you want, when you want. This is your journey.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Goal
Choose what you want to master. Make it specific, measurable, and repeatable.

### 2. Track Your Progress
Log each repetition as you complete it. Watch your progress bar grow from 0 to 100.

### 3. Stay Motivated
See your streak, celebrate milestones, and build the identity of someone who finishes what they start.

### 4. Achieve Mastery
By rep 100, you won't just have a new skill - you'll be a different person.

## Who This Is For

### For Learners
Track your language learning, coding practice, or any educational goal. Consistency beats intensity every time.

### For Athletes
Build physical habits that last. From daily runs to push-ups to yoga, repetition builds bodies.

### For Creators
Writers, artists, musicians - your craft improves through repetition. Track your daily practice and watch your skills compound.

### For Personal Growth
Meditation, journaling, gratitude practice - build the habits that transform your mental health and well-being.

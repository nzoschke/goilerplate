## Goal Limits Explained

### Why Limits Matter

Goal limits exist to encourage focus:
- **Too many goals** = scattered effort
- **Right amount** = sustainable progress
- **Limits force prioritization**

### What Counts as "Active"?

An active goal is one that:
- Is not yet complete (< 100 reps)
- Is not deleted

Completed goals (100/100) don't count toward your limit.

### What If I Hit My Limit?

**Free (3 goals):**
Options:
1. Complete one goal to free up a slot
2. Delete/archive a goal you're not pursuing
3. Upgrade to Pro for 25 goals

**Pro (25 goals):**
Options:
1. Complete some goals (you've got this!)
2. Archive inactive goals
3. Upgrade to Enterprise for unlimited

**Enterprise (Unlimited):**
No limits! Track as many as you want.

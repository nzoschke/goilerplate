## Logging Progress

The core action in Law of 100 is simple: log a rep when you complete one.

### How to Add Progress

1. Navigate to your goal
2. Click the **"+ Add Progress"** button
3. Your counter increments: 23/100 → 24/100
4. Your progress bar updates automatically

That's it! Keep it simple.

### When to Log

**Best Practice**: Log immediately after completing a rep
- Captures the momentum and satisfaction
- Prevents forgetting
- Reinforces the habit loop

**Acceptable**: Log at end of day
- Review your day
- Log all completed reps
- Better late than never

### Editing Progress

Need to adjust? You can:
- Add notes to individual reps (coming soon)
- View your complete history
- Track multiple reps in one day if needed

## Progress Visualization

### Progress Bar
Visual representation of your journey from 0 to 100. Watching it fill up is incredibly motivating.

### Percentage Complete
See exactly how far you've come: "47% complete"

### Current Step
Always know where you are: "47/100"

### Status Badge

- **Completed**: You did it! 🎉

## Viewing History

### Sorting and Filtering

- **Title**: Alphabetical

Filter by:
- **Active**: Currently working on
- **Completed**: Finished goals

## Understanding Your Progress

### Key Milestones

We automatically highlight important milestones:

- **Day 10**: First milestone - proven commitment
- **Day 25**: Quarter mark - building momentum
- **Day 50**: Halfway point - over the hump!
- **Day 75**: Home stretch - finish line in sight
- **Day 100**: Victory! Goal completed

### Progress Insights

Your progress tells a story:

**Consistent**: Regular reps, steady progress
→ Keep doing what you're doing!

**Sporadic**: Long gaps, burst activity
→ Consider setting daily reminders

**Plateauing**: Stuck at same number for days
→ Time to re-commit or adjust your goal

## Best Practices

### Daily Tracking
Track daily (or at your chosen frequency). Consistency is the secret ingredient.

### Honest Logging
Only log reps you actually complete. You're only cheating yourself otherwise.

### Celebrate Small Wins
Every 10 reps, acknowledge your progress. You're doing something most people never do - following through.

### Don't Break the Chain
Visual streaks are powerful motivators. Try to keep your chain of X's unbroken.

## Playback & Queue

JukeLab's playback system keeps the music flowing while giving guests control over what plays next.

## How the Queue Works

### Guest Queuing

When guests open your shared link, they can:

1. **Browse your collection** - See all 100 albums you've curated
2. **View album tracks** - Tap an album to see all songs
3. **Add to queue** - Tap a song to add it to the queue
4. **See what's coming** - View the current queue

### Queue Order

Songs play in the order they were added:

1. Currently playing track
2. Songs queued by guests (in order added)
3. Smart shuffle picks (when queue is empty)

### Multiple Guests

When multiple guests queue songs:
- Songs are added in real-time
- Everyone sees the same queue
- First-come, first-served ordering

## Smart Shuffle

When the queue is empty, smart shuffle takes over.

### How It Works

Smart shuffle plays songs from your collection with these rules:

- **No repeat artists** - Won't play the same artist back-to-back
- **Album variety** - Spreads selections across your collection
- **Continuous play** - Never stops, never goes silent

### When It Activates

Smart shuffle fills in when:
- No songs are in the queue
- The last queued song finishes
- You clear the queue

### Overriding Shuffle

Guests can always add songs to queue, which play before shuffle picks.

## Host Controls

The host (on the jukebox device) has full control:

### Playback Controls

- **Play/Pause** - Stop and start music
- **Skip** - Jump to the next song
- **Volume** - Adjust playback volume

### Queue Management

- **Clear queue** - Remove all queued songs
- **Remove song** - Delete individual songs from queue
- **Add songs** - Queue songs yourself (you're a guest too!)

### Display Options

- **Now Playing** - Shows current track and album art
- **Up Next** - Shows the next few songs in queue
- **Full Queue** - View the entire queue

## Now Playing Screen

The jukebox device shows a beautiful now-playing screen:

**What's Displayed:**
- Album artwork (large)
- Song title
- Artist name
- Album name
- Queue status

**Why It Matters:**

Set up the jukebox where guests can see it. The display:
- Shows guests what's playing
- Encourages participation
- Creates visual ambiance
- Confirms when songs get queued

## Tips for Hosts

### Before the Party

- Queue 3-5 songs to establish the vibe
- Test that playback works
- Make sure volume is set correctly

### During the Party

- Let smart shuffle and guests handle music
- Only intervene if something feels off
- Enjoy not being the DJ!

### If No One's Queuing

Don't worry—smart shuffle keeps playing. Some crowds take time to warm up. The music never stops either way.

## Technical Notes

### Latency

- Queue updates in real-time (within 1-2 seconds)
- All guests see the same queue state
- Works across different devices and browsers

### Connection

- Requires internet for Spotify playback
- Guest devices need internet to browse/queue
- Connoisseur offline mode works without internet (using MP3s)

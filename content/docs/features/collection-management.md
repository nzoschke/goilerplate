## Building Your Collection

Your collection is the heart of JukeLab. Learn how to curate, organize, and maintain your 100-album library.

### Adding Albums from Spotify

1. Go to your JukeLab dashboard
2. Click **"Add Albums"**
3. Browse your Spotify library or search
4. Click **"Add"** on albums you want
5. See your collection count grow

### Search Tips

- **Search by artist** - Find all albums by a specific artist
- **Search by album** - Find a specific album title
- **Browse saved** - See albums already in your Spotify library
- **Browse playlists** - Find albums from your playlists

### Collection Limit

- All plans support up to **100 albums**
- This equals roughly 1,200+ songs
- You can have fewer than 100

## Organizing Your Collection

### Viewing Your Collection

Your collection page shows:
- All added albums
- Album artwork
- Artist names
- Track counts

### Removing Albums

To remove an album:
1. Go to your collection
2. Find the album
3. Click **"Remove"**
4. Confirm removal

**Note:** Removing an album removes all its songs from your jukebox. Guests can no longer queue those tracks.

### Replacing Albums

Swap albums as your taste evolves:
1. Remove albums that didn't work well
2. Add new ones you want to try
3. Your collection updates immediately

## Multiple Jukeboxes

Create different collections for different occasions:

- **Dinner Party** - Mellow jazz, soul, acoustic
- **House Party** - Upbeat, danceable, crowd pleasers
- **Game Night** - Instrumental, lo-fi, ambient
- **BBQ** - Rock, reggae, classic hits

### Creating Another Jukebox

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click **"New Jukebox"**
3. Name it (e.g., "Dinner Party Mix")
4. Curate 100 albums for this occasion

Each jukebox has its own:
- Collection
- Guest link
- Queue

## Collection Strategy

### Balance Your Collection

Aim for variety across:

| Category | Album Count | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Crowd Pleasers | 40-50 | Classics everyone knows |
| Energy Builders | 20-25 | Dance, party anthems |
| Vibe Setters | 15-20 | Mellow, atmospheric |
| Wild Cards | 10-15 | Your personal favorites |

### Quality Over Quantity

Every album should pass this test:

- Would you be happy if any random track played?
- Does every song hold up, not just the hits?
- Does it fit the overall vibe?

### Update Regularly

After each party:
- Note which albums never got played
- Note which songs guests loved
- Swap out underperformers
- Add new discoveries

## MP3 Collections (Connoisseur)

Connoisseur plan users can add MP3 files:

### Adding MP3s

1. Go to **"Add Albums"**
2. Select **"Upload MP3s"**
3. Organize files by album folder
4. Upload and tag your music

### Why Use MP3s?

- **Offline mode** - Works without internet
- **Rare tracks** - Music not on Spotify
- **Vinyl digitization** - Add your physical collection
- **Local artists** - Independent music you own

## Best Practices

### Start Small

Don't try to curate 100 albums at once:
1. Start with 30-50 albums you know well
2. Test at a small gathering
3. Add more based on what works
4. Iterate over time

### Get Feedback

Ask guests after parties:
- "Any songs you wished we had?"
- "Anything that felt out of place?"
- "What was the highlight?"

Use feedback to improve your collection.

### Keep It Fresh

Rotate albums periodically:
- Add new releases you love
- Remove albums that never get picked
- Refresh seasonal selections

Your collection should evolve with your taste and your guests' preferences.

## Creating Goals

### The Basics

1. Click **"Start New Goal"** from your dashboard
2. Enter a **Title** - be specific
3. Add a **Description** (optional but recommended)
4. Click **"Start Goal"**

Your goal is now active and ready to track!

### Goal Title Guidelines

**Good Titles:**
- "Practice Spanish for 15 minutes daily"
- "Do 20 push-ups"
- "Write 500 words"
- "Meditate for 10 minutes"

**Poor Titles:**
- "Get better" (too vague)
- "Exercise" (not specific enough)
- "Learn stuff" (what stuff?)

The more specific, the better. Future you will thank you.

### Descriptions

Use the description to:
- Explain what success looks like
- Note why this matters to you
- Define specific parameters
- Add motivational reminders

**Example:**
```
Title: Practice Guitar Scales
Description: 20 minutes of focused practice on major and
minor scales. Goal is to play them smoothly at 120 BPM
by day 100. This matters because I want to join a band
next year.
```

## Editing Goals

Need to adjust your goal? You can edit:
- Title
- Description

**Note**: You cannot edit the current progress count. Progress is sacred - it represents actual work completed.

### When to Edit

**Good reasons to edit:**
- Clarify vague language
- Add more context to description
- Fix typos

**Bad reasons to edit:**
- Making goal easier because it's hard
- Changing goal completely mid-journey
- Adjusting to avoid accountability

If your goal needs significant changes, consider completing the current one and starting a new one.

## Archiving vs. Deleting

### Completed Goals

When you reach 100/100, your goal is automatically marked as **Completed** and moved to your completed goals archive.

You can still:
- View complete history
- Export data (Pro/Enterprise)
- Reference for future goals

### Abandoning Goals

Sometimes you need to stop a goal before 100. That's okay! Here's how to handle it:

**Option 1: Keep It**
Leave it as-is in your active goals. Maybe you'll come back to it.

**Option 2: Delete It**
If you're sure you won't continue, delete it. Your other goals deserve your focus.

**No Shame**: Adjusting goals is part of the process. Better to focus on goals you'll actually complete than keep dead goals around.

## Organizing Multiple Goals

Working on multiple goals? Here's how to stay organized:

### Use Sorting

Sort your goals dashboard by:

**Recent**: See what you've worked on lately
- Great for daily review
- Catch goals you've neglected

**Progress**: Focus on completion
- Prioritize goals close to finishing
- Get quick wins

**Title**: Alphabetical organization
- Find specific goals quickly
- Clean, organized view

### Priority System

Since we don't have a built-in priority feature (yet!), use title prefixes:

```
🔥 Learn Python - High priority
⭐ Morning Journaling - Medium priority
📚 Read 30 Pages - Low priority
```

Simple but effective!

### Focus on One at a Time

**Controversial advice**: Despite allowing multiple goals, we recommend focusing on ONE goal at a time until you hit 30+ days.

Why?
- Builds discipline muscle
- Proves you can follow through
- Better results than spreading yourself thin

Once you've proven you can do one goal for 30+ days, add another.

## Goal Limits by Plan

## Best Practices

### Start Small
One focused goal beats three half-hearted ones.

### Be Specific
"Practice coding" is vague. "Complete one LeetCode problem" is specific.

### Make It Measurable
You should be able to answer "Did I do it today?" with a clear yes or no.

### Choose Actions, Not Outcomes
- ❌ "Lose 20 pounds" (outcome)
- ✅ "Walk 10,000 steps daily" (action)

Actions are under your control. Outcomes aren't always.

### Review Weekly
Every Sunday, review your goals:
- Which need more attention?
- Which are on track?
- Any need to be adjusted or archived?

## Troubleshooting

### "I have too many goals"

If you're overwhelmed:
1. Archive/delete goals you're not actively working on
2. Focus on your top 1-3 goals
3. Add others back later

Quality > Quantity, always.

### "I keep starting but not finishing"

This is common. Try:
- Pick ONE goal only
- Make it smaller/easier
- Set a daily reminder
- Find an accountability partner

The problem isn't usually the goal. It's trying to do too much at once.

### "My goal limit feels restrictive"

Good! Limits force prioritization. What REALLY matters?

If you consistently max out your goal limit and finish them, you're ready for an upgrade.

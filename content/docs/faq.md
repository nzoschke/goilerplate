## Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions about using Law of 100.

## Getting Started

### What is the Law of 100?

The Law of 100 is a simple principle: **do something 100 times to achieve mastery.** Consistent repetition over 100 iterations transforms skills from conscious effort to unconscious competence.

### Is this really free?

Yes! Our Free plan is free forever. No credit card required. No tricks.

You get 3 active goals and full progress tracking. Upgrade to Pro or Enterprise if you need more goals or advanced features.

### Do I need to do something 100 days in a row?

No! The goal is **100 total repetitions**, not necessarily 100 consecutive days.

That said, daily consistency usually leads to better results and faster completion. But if you miss a day, just continue. The app tracks total reps, not perfect streaks.

### What should my first goal be?

Start with something:
- You can practice daily (or frequently)
- Takes 10-30 minutes
- Is measurable (clear yes/no: did I do it?)
- Excites and challenges you

Check out our [Choosing Your Goals](/docs/guides/choosing-goals) guide for detailed help.

## Using the App

### How do I log progress?

1. Click on your goal
2. Click the **"Add Progress"** button (or **"+"**)
3. Your counter updates automatically

That's it! Log immediately after completing each rep for best results.

### Can I log multiple reps in one day?

Yes! If you do your practice multiple times in one day, you can log multiple reps.

The app tracks total count from 0 to 100, regardless of how long it takes.

### What if I miss a day?

Missing a day doesn't erase your progress. Your count stays the same - you just continue tomorrow.

**Pro tip:** Never miss two days in a row. One miss is a hiccup, two is a pattern.

### Can I edit or delete progress?

Currently, you can view your complete history but not edit individual reps. This ensures data integrity and honest tracking.

If you made a major mistake (like accidentally logging 10 reps), contact support and we can help.

### Can I pause a goal?

There's no formal "pause" feature, but you can simply stop logging progress for a while. Your goal stays active and you can resume anytime.

If you know you won't continue, consider deleting it to keep your dashboard focused.

## Goals & Limits

### How many goals can I have?

Depends on your plan:
- **Free**: 3 active goals
- **Pro**: 25 active goals
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited goals

Completed goals (100/100) don't count toward your limit.

### What counts as an "active" goal?

Any goal that hasn't reached 100 reps yet and hasn't been deleted.

Once you complete a goal (100/100), it's automatically moved to your "Completed" archive and doesn't count toward your limit.

### Why is there a goal limit?

Limits encourage focus. Most people are more successful with 1-3 deeply committed goals than 10 half-hearted ones.

That said, if you consistently max out your limit, you're ready for an upgrade!

### Can I delete a goal?

Yes. If you decide to abandon a goal, you can delete it from your dashboard.

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent. Your progress data will be lost. Consider carefully.

### What happens to completed goals?

They move to your "Completed" archive where you can:
- View your complete history
- See when you finished
- Reference for future goals
- Export the data (Pro/Enterprise)

Completed goals don't count toward your active goal limit.

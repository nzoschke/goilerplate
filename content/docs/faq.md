## Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions about using JukeLab.

## Getting Started

### What is JukeLab?

JukeLab is a party music app that lets you curate a collection of 100 albums. Guests browse your collection and queue songs from their own phones—no more fighting over Bluetooth.

### Do I need Spotify Premium?

Yes, JukeLab requires Spotify Premium for playback. The Connoisseur plan also supports MP3 files for offline use.

### Is there a free plan?

We offer two paid plans: Nerd ($5/month) and Connoisseur ($10/month). Both include a free trial to test things out.

### Why 100 albums?

100 albums (~1,200+ songs) provides enough variety for any party while keeping the collection curated and manageable. You can have fewer, but 100 is the sweet spot.

### What devices work with JukeLab?

Any device with a modern browser works:
- Tablets (ideal for display)
- Phones
- Laptops/desktops

For jukebox mode, we recommend a dedicated device you can leave near your speakers.

## Using JukeLab

### How do guests add songs?

1. Share your guest link
2. Guests open it in their browser
3. They browse your collection
4. Tap to add songs to the queue

No app install or account required for guests.

### Can guests play any song from Spotify?

No—guests can only queue songs from albums you've added to your collection. This ensures everything stays on-vibe.

### What if nobody is queueing?

Smart shuffle plays songs from your collection automatically. Guests can jump in and queue anytime.

### What if someone queues too much of one artist?

Smart shuffle ensures variety. The system won't play the same artist back-to-back, even if queued.

### Can I skip songs?

Yes! The host can skip, clear the queue, or add songs at any time from the jukebox device.

### Does it work offline?

The Connoisseur plan includes offline mode. You'll need to add MP3 files to your collection beforehand. Perfect for venues without reliable WiFi.

## Collection & Albums

### How do I add albums to my collection?

1. Connect your Spotify account
2. Browse your library or search Spotify
3. Click "Add to Collection" on albums you want
4. Build up to 100 albums

### Can I remove albums?

Yes, you can edit your collection anytime. Add and remove albums as your taste evolves.

### Do I have to have exactly 100 albums?

No—you can have fewer. But more albums means more variety for your guests to choose from.

### Can I create multiple jukeboxes?

Common fixes:

3. Check that Spotify isn't playing elsewhere
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### The queue isn't updating

Usually a connection issue:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check your internet
3. Make sure the jukebox device is still running

### Can I use JukeLab on multiple devices?

Yes! Your account syncs across devices. But only one device should be in "jukebox mode" (connected to speakers) at a time.

## Hosting Tips

### What's the best jukebox setup?

- Use a dedicated tablet or old phone as the jukebox display
- Place it somewhere visible so guests can see what's playing
- Connect to speakers via Bluetooth, aux, or AirPlay
- Share the guest link via QR code on a table card

### How do I share the guest link?

- Text it to guests
- Create a QR code (many free generators online)
- Print it on a party sign
- Share it in a group chat

### Should I pre-queue songs?

It's nice to have a few songs queued before guests arrive. This sets the vibe and gives latecomers a sense of what's playing.

### What if guests don't participate?

Some crowds are shy at first. Try:
- Mentioning the jukebox as people arrive
- Having a visible QR code
- Queueing a few songs yourself to show how it works

The music plays either way via smart shuffle.

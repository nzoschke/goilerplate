## Quick Start Guide

Getting started with JukeLab takes about 10 minutes. Let's walk through creating your first jukebox.

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Click **"Get Started Free"** on the homepage
2. Sign up with your email or use Google/GitHub
3. Verify your email address
4. You're in!

## Step 2: Connect Spotify

JukeLab works with your Spotify Premium account.

1. Click **"Connect Spotify"** in your dashboard
2. Log in to Spotify and authorize JukeLab
3. Your Spotify library is now available for curation

**Note:** Spotify Premium is required for playback control. The Connoisseur plan also supports MP3 files.

## Step 3: Curate Your Collection

Now the fun part: choosing your 100 albums.

### What Makes a Great Collection?

A great jukebox collection should be:

- ✅ **Varied**: Cover different genres and eras
- ✅ **Quality throughout**: Every track on every album should hold up
- ✅ **Guest-friendly**: Include recognizable crowd pleasers
- ✅ **Personal**: Add your favorites that always get great reactions

### Adding Albums

1. Browse your Spotify library or search for albums
2. Click **"Add to Collection"** on albums you want
3. See your collection grow in the sidebar
4. Aim for 100 albums (you can have fewer, but more = more variety)

### Pro Tips

- **Mix eras**: Include classics alongside recent releases
- **Cover moods**: High energy, mellow, sing-along—variety matters
- **Include guilty pleasures**: ABBA belongs in your jukebox
- **Avoid one-hit-wonders**: Every song should be good

## Step 4: Set Up Your Jukebox Device

Choose a device to run your jukebox:

- **Old tablet** (ideal—set it on a table for guests to see)
- **Spare phone**
- **Laptop**

This device shows the now-playing screen and connects to your speakers.

### Setup Steps

1. Open JukeLab on your jukebox device
2. Go to your jukebox
3. Click **"Enter Jukebox Mode"**
4. Connect to your speaker (Bluetooth, aux, or Airplay)
5. The screen shows now-playing and the queue

## Step 5: Share the Guest Link

Time to let your guests in!

1. Click **"Share"** or **"Get Guest Link"**
2. Copy the link
3. Share via text, email, or a QR code at your party

Guests can:
- Browse your 100 albums
- See what's playing and queued
- Add songs to the queue
- All from their own phones

## Step 6: Start the Party

Hit play and let the music flow. Here's what to expect:

### Smart Shuffle

When nobody's actively queueing, smart shuffle plays from your collection. It ensures variety—no artist plays twice in a row.

### Guest Queuing

When guests add songs, they play in order after the current queue. Popular picks rise naturally.

### Your Control

You can always:
- Skip a song
- Add songs yourself
- Adjust volume
- Clear the queue if needed

## Your First Party: What to Expect

### Before Guests Arrive

- Start playing some mellow music to set the vibe
- Make sure the guest link is easy to share (maybe a QR code on the table)
- Test that your jukebox device is connected to speakers

### As Guests Arrive

- Share the link as people show up
- Give them a quick explanation: "Browse my albums, queue whatever you want"
- Watch the queue start filling up

### During the Party

- Relax! The music handles itself
- Guests will read the room and queue appropriately
- You're free to actually enjoy hosting

## Common Beginner Questions

### What if nobody queues anything?

Smart shuffle keeps playing from your collection. Guests can jump in whenever they want. No awkward silence.

### What if someone queues the same artist over and over?

Smart shuffle ensures variety. The system prevents back-to-back plays from the same artist.

### Do guests need Spotify accounts?

No! Guests only need the link. They browse and queue through their browser—no app or account required.

### Can guests play anything from Spotify?

No—guests can only queue songs from albums in your collection. That's the point! You curate, they choose.

### What if my internet goes down?

The Connoisseur plan includes offline mode with MP3 support. For Nerd plans, you'll need internet for Spotify playback.

## Quick Start Guide

Getting started with Law of 100 takes less than 2 minutes. Let's walk through creating your first goal.

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Click **"Start Your First Goal"** on the homepage
2. Sign up with your email or use Google/GitHub
3. Verify your email address
4. You're in!

## Step 2: Create Your First Goal

Once you're logged in, you'll see your dashboard. Time to create your first goal.

### What Makes a Good Goal?

A good first goal should be:

- ✅ **Specific**: "Write 500 words daily" not "Get better at writing"
- ✅ **Measurable**: You can clearly say "yes, I did it" or "no, I didn't"
- ✅ **Daily or Regular**: Something you can practice frequently
- ✅ **10-30 minutes**: Long enough to matter, short enough to sustain
- ✅ **Exciting**: You're motivated to work on it, not just "should" do it

### Creating Your Goal

1. Click **"Start New Goal"**
2. Enter your goal title
   - Example: "Practice Spanish Conversation"
   - Example: "Do 20 Push-ups"
   - Example: "Write 500 Words"
3. Add a description (optional but recommended)
   - What do you want to achieve?
   - Why does this matter to you?
   - What will success look like?
4. Click **"Start Goal"**

That's it! Your goal is now live.

## Step 3: Log Your First Rep

Now comes the important part: actually doing the thing.

1. Complete your first repetition (go do it right now!)
2. Come back to the app
3. Click on your goal
4. Click **"Add Progress"** or the **"+"** button
5. Your counter updates: **1/100** ✨

Congratulations! You've taken the hardest step - starting.

## Step 4: Build Your Streak

Now the journey really begins. Your goal is to log reps consistently.

### Tips for Building a Streak

**Set a Schedule**: Pick a specific time each day
- "After my morning coffee"
- "During my lunch break"
- "Before bed"

**Start Small**: Don't try to be perfect
- Tired? Do a shorter version
- Busy? Do the minimum
- Just show up

**Track Immediately**: Log your rep right after completing it
- Don't wait until end of day
- Strike while the motivation is hot

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Goal Cards
Each goal shows:
- Title and description
- Current progress (e.g., "23/100")
- Progress bar visualization
- Status (Active or Completed)

### Sorting Options
Sort your goals by:
- **Recent**: Last updated goals first
- **Progress**: Closest to completion first
- **Title**: Alphabetical order

### Quick Actions
- Click a goal to see details
- Click "+" to add progress
- View your complete history

## Your First Week

Here's what to expect in your first week:

### Days 1-3: The Honeymoon
You're excited. Motivation is high. Enjoy it, but don't rely on it.

### Days 4-7: The Reality Check
Motivation fades. This is normal. This is where discipline begins.

**The Secret**: You don't need motivation. You just need to show up.

## Common Beginner Questions

### What if I miss a day?

**Option 1**: If you catch it quickly (within 24 hours), log it late. We track total reps, not perfect streaks.

**Option 2**: Just continue tomorrow. One missed day doesn't erase your progress.

**Remember**: The goal is 100 total reps, not a perfect 100-day streak.

### Can I work on multiple goals?

Yes! But we recommend starting with just one goal until you hit 30 days. Building one solid habit is better than juggling multiple weak ones.

**Free Plan**: Up to 3 active goals
**Pro Plan**: Up to 25 active goals
**Enterprise**: Unlimited goals

### How long should each rep take?

This depends on your goal. Most people find success with:
- Physical goals: 15-30 minutes
- Learning goals: 20-30 minutes
- Creative goals: 30-45 minutes
- Mindfulness: 10-20 minutes

**The key**: Consistency beats duration. 15 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly.

### What happens when I reach 100?

Celebration! 🎉

Your goal is marked as **Completed** and archived. You can:
- View your complete history
- Export your data (Pro/Enterprise)
- Start a new related goal
- Take a well-deserved break

Most importantly: **you've proven to yourself that you finish what you start.** That's a superpower.
